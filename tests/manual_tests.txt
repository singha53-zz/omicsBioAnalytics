Manual testing for Shiny App using sample data
- why? shinytest has too many hard to debug issues at the present time

Manual test Log:
- April 27, 2020, all checks below PASSED; by Amrit Singh.

Heart Failure

objectives
1) data upload
- download heart failure data
- upload demo for metadata and select the tab separator: if file is correct dropdown menus to select the response variable and reference level should appear; choose "hospitalizations" as the response variable and choose "No" as the reference level
- upload cells, holder and proteins for the Omics data
test 1
- click Alexa button: "This functionality has been suspended..." message should appear
- click the Run Analysis button: a inProgress followed by a notification to click on the Analysis tab should appear on the bottom right of the page.

2) metadata analysis
test 1
- input: continuous variable: Brain_Natriuretic_Peptide, log transform variable: No, test: kruskal-wallis
- output: p-value 0.1042, no linear regression assumptions button should be visible below the R-console verbatimTextOutput
test 2
- input: continuous variable: Brain_Natriuretic_Peptide, log transform variable: Yes, test: linear regression
- output: p-value 0.07035683, linear regression assumptions button should be visible below the R-console verbatimTextOutput and should display tests for model assumptions
test 3
- input: categorical variable: Ischemia
- output: p-value = 0.00127

3) exploratory data analysis
test 1
- input: tab cells, ncomp = 5
- output: std of PC5 is 1.096
test 2
- input: tab holter, ncomp = 4
- output: association between PC3 and Diuretic is 0.01 < p < 0.05, download the heatmap
test 4
- input: tab proteins, ncomp = 2
- output: association between PC3 and Diuretic is p < 0.01
test 5
- color of "No" points on the PCA SPLOM is gray
- color of "Yes" points on the PCA SPLOM is gold

4) differential expression analysis
tab cells
test 1
- input: click on the only significant point
- output: a violin plot of Monocytes should appear on the right and additional details should appear above the volcano plot.
test 2
- input: type "d" and select dendritic cells
- output: select Dendritic.cells.activated from autocomplete dropdown menu and the corresponding plot should display
tab holter
test 1
- input: click on the only significant point
- output: a violin plot of HS_HR_AVE_DayToNight should appear on the right and additional details should appear above the volcano plot.
test 2
- input: click on the "Significant variables" button to see additional details for HS_HR_AVE_DayToNight
- output: a modal should appear showing a datable of the significant features (red points on the volcano plot, in this case: HS_HR_AVE_DayToNight)
tab proteins
- input: type in MMP7 in the input box and click plot options and change x-axis and y-axis text size to 20.
- output: MMP7 vs. hospitalizations should appear with axis labels with larger axis labels. p-value = 0.90
geneses enrichment analysis
- input: choose 11 pathways, plot options (vjust = 1, just = 1, xAngle = 40)
- output: plot should be easier to read with non overlapping symbols
drug enrichment
unregulated proteins: "No enriched compounds at an FDR = 0.15", downloaded file should show no compounds
down regulated proteins: 5 enriched compounds, downloaded file should show 5 compounds.
- color of "No" points on the PCA SPLOM is gray
- color of "Yes" points on the PCA SPLOM is gold


5) biomarker analysis
- clicking on "Build Penalized Regression Models!" should show two error messages.
- input: select all datasets to build single and ensemble classifiers
test 1
- Performance tab: check if 4 ROCs are produced: 3 datasets and 1 ensemble
test 2
- Panels tab: check upset plot and bar plots of selected features; check if download button works
test 3
- PCA plots tab: test each radio button for PCA plots of each dataset; check if Ensemble PCA plot is displayed
- color of "No" points on the plot is gray
- color of "Yes" points on the plot is gold
test 4
- Heatmaps tab: test each radio button for PCA plots of each dataset; check if Ensemble PCA plot is displayed
- color of "No" points on the heat map is gray
- color of "Yes" points on the heat map is gold
test 5: 
- Biological significance of ensemble panel tab: Coronary aftery disease (square) is connected  to APM, APOA2, PON3, CRP, and CST3 (circles) at r=0.5 and FDR=0.05 cut-offs
