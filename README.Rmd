**Omics BioAnalytics** is a Shiny app that perform common bioinformatics analyses such as descriptive analyses of demographics variables, exploratory data analysis, differential expression analysis and biomarker discovery analysis. The can either use the provided sample data to run through the various analyses of the app or upload their own data (demographics variables, omics data).

## Installing
- assuming R is installed. 

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("singha53/omicsBioAnalytics")
```

## Get started

- Step 1) add inst/app/makeEnvVars.R with the following contents (.Renvion worked locally but not on shinyapps.io):

```r
saveRDS("your-s3-bucket-name", "S3BUCKET.rds")
saveRDS("your-aws-access-key", "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID.rds")
saveRDS("your-aws-secret-access-key", "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.rds")
saveRDS("your-aws-region", "AWS_DEFAULT_REGION.rds")
saveRDS("your-dynamodb-table-name", "TABLE_NAME.rds")
```

> The above script is sourced in global.R and the env are set locally and on shinyapps.io at runtime.

- Step 2) run the Shiny webapp

```r
library(omicsBioAnalytics);
omicsBioAnalytics::start_app()
```

## Programming/Scripting Languages
### Web-app

## Features

- analyze multiple omics data obtained on the same set of subjects (samples/observations)
- interactive visualizations (heatmaps, networks, statistical graphs)
- RShiny app as an R-package
- voice-enabled analytics using an Alexa Skill

## Room for improvements

- use of Shiny modules to improve server-side code
- use of R6Class to improve code

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature
branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome.

Note: if you build your own omicsBioAnalytics R-package and host it on your own github, then prior to deploying the app to shinyapps.io, make sure to restart your R session, then install the package from Github.
