**Omics BioAnalytics** is a Shiny app that perform common bioinformatics analyses such as descriptive analyses of demographics variables, exploratory data analysis, differential expression analysis and biomarker discovery analysis. The can either use the provided sample data to run through the various analyses of the app or upload their own data (demographics variables, omics data).

## Installing
- assuming R is installed. 

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("singha53/omicsBioAnalytics")
```

## Get started

```r
library(omicsBioAnalytics);
omicsBioAnalytics::startApp()
```

## Programming/Scripting Languages
### Web-app
- RShiny
- RStudio

### Multi-model app
- Alexa Skill Kit
- JavaScript (Node.js, v8.11.2)
- npm (v6.4.0) 

## Sample datasets used for this app

### Heart Failure case study

### How to use?

```r
library(omicsBioAnalytics);
data(heartFailure)
```

### How to generate?

### Pathway datasets

### How to use?

```r
library(omicsBioAnalytics);
data(pathwayDB)
```

### How to generate?

[steps to reproduce the heartFailure data](https://github.com/singha53/omicsBioAnalytics/blob/master/inst/extdata/pathwayDB/pathways.md)

## Features

- analyze multiple omics data obtained on the same set of subjects (samples/observations)
- interactive visualizations (heatmaps, networks, statistical graphs)
- RShiny app as an R-package

## Room for improvements

- use of Shiny modules to improve server-side code
- use of R6Class to improve code

## Challenges

- .Renvion worked locally but not on shinyapps.io, therefore I set the env upon app using inst/app/makeEnvVars.R with the following contents:

```r
saveRDS("s3-bucket-name", "S3BUCKET.rds")
saveRDS("aws-access-key", "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID.rds")
saveRDS("aws-secret-access-key", "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.rds")
saveRDS("aws-region", "AWS_DEFAULT_REGION.rds")
```

> The above script is sourced in global.R and the env are set.
